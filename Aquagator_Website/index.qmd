## About Aquagator

Aquagator is an autonomous robot designed to collect water samples from depths that are typically inaccessible without a dive suit. Aquagator is able to recognize water depth and take water chemistry readings like pH, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen.

### Key features

-   Autonomous depth control and navigation
-   Pressure-rated sampling chamber for deep-water collection
-   Modular sensor suite (temperature, conductivity, depth, pH, dissolved oxygen)

### Project Partners
-   French Creek Valley Conservancy
-   Watershed Conservation and Research Center
